//The Ulam sequence U is defined by u0=u, u1=v, with the general term u_n for n>2 given by the least integer expressible uniquely as the sum of two distinct earlier terms.
//In other words, the next number is always the smallest, unique sum of any two previous terms.
//
//The first 10 terms of the sequence U(u0=1, u1=2) are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18].
//
//Here, the first term after the initial 1, 2 is obviously 3 since 3=1+2.
//The next term is 4=1+3 (we don't have to worry about 4=2+2 since it is a sum of a single term instead of two distinct terms)
//5 is not a member of the sequence since it is representable in two ways: 5=1+4=2+3, but 6=2+4 is a member (since 3+3 isn't a valid calculation).
//You'll have to write a code that creates an Ulam Sequence starting with u0, u1 and containing n terms.
